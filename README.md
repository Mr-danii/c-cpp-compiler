# CinCout

This project is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for _C/C++_ language. It allows users to write code, compile, analyze, and run C/C++ programs directly in their web browser. The application is built using TypeScript/Node.js for the backend and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

First, install the required packages:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm gcc g++ clang clang-format valgrind cppcheck
```

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pp3ng/CinCout.git
```

2. Build and start the application:

```bash
# Install dependencies and build both frontend and backend
npm install
npm run build

# Start the server
npm start
```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:9527

## Run with Docker (Recommended)

Docker provides an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-installed, making deployment simple and ensures safety and security.

please make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

This project provides a Dockerfile that allows you to run the application in a Docker container.

### Build and Run the Docker Image

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd CinCout
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build -d

```

Then you can access the application at http://localhost:9527

### Using Nginx as a Reverse Proxy (Optional)

1. Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Create an Nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/CinCout
```

3. Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Replace with your domain or server IP

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9527;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

4. Enable the site and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/CinCout /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test if the configuration is valid
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

5. Configure firewall to only allow Nginx and block direct access to port 9527:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'  # Allow HTTP and HTTPS through Nginx
sudo ufw deny 9527           # Block direct access to the application port
```

6. Optional: Configure the application to only listen on localhost (127.0.0.1)

For added security, you can modify the server.ts file to only listen on localhost instead of all interfaces:

```typescript
// Find the server.listen line in backend/src/server.ts
// Change from:
// server.listen(port, () => { ... });
// To:
server.listen(port, "127.0.0.1", () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This ensures application is only accessible through Nginx and not directly via port 9527 from the internet, adding an extra layer of security to deployment.
