# CinCout

This project is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for _C/C++_ language. It allows users to write code, compile, analyze, and run C/C++ programs directly in their web browser. The application is built using `Node.js` for the backend and `React` for the frontend. It provides a user-friendly interface with rich features.

## Architecture

The project follows a clean separation between frontend and backend:

![architecture](README/Architecture.png)

- **Frontend**: Browser-based editor with TypeScript and modern APIs
- **Backend**: Node.js server handling compilation, execution, and analysis
- **Communication**: WebSockets for real-time interaction between client and server

## Technical Stack

### Frontend

- **Core**: React with TypeScript
- **Editor**: CodeMirror with syntax highlighting and code folding
- **Terminal**: Xterm.js for interactive program execution
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds
- **Communication**: Socket.IO client for real-time communication

### Backend

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **API**: koa.js for HTTP endpoints
- **WebSockets**: Socket.IO for real-time communication
- **Process Management**: Node-PTY for spawning and managing compiler and program processes
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment
