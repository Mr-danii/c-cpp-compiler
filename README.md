# CinCout

This project is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for _C/C++_ language. It allows users to write code, compile, analyze, and run C/C++ programs directly in their web browser. The application is built using TypeScript/Node.js for the backend and HTML/CSS/TypeScript for the frontend. It provides a user-friendly interface with rich features.
