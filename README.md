## Run with Docker (Recommended)

Docker provides an isolated environment with all dependencies pre-installed, making deployment simple and ensures safety and security.

please make sure you have Docker installed on your system. You can follow the official [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your operating system.

This project provides a Dockerfile that allows you to run the application in a Docker container.

### Build and Run the Docker Image

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd CinCout
# Build and run
docker-compose up --build -d

```

#### or

pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull pp3ng/cincout:latest
docker run -d -p 9527:9527 pp3ng/cincout:latest
```

Then you can access the application at http://localhost:9527
