# Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

First, install the required packages:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm gcc g++ clang clang-format valgrind cppcheck
```

## Project Setup

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pp3ng/webCpp.git

# Change directory
cd webCpp

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

2. Start the application:

```bash
# Start the server
node backend/server.js
```

3. Access the application at http://localhost:9527

## Run as a Background Service (Optional)

### Using PM2 to Manage the Application

1. Install PM2:

```bash
# Install PM2 globally
npm install pm2 -g
```

2. Start the application with PM2:

```bash
# Start the application
pm2 start backend/server.js --name "webCpp"

# Set up startup script to run on server boot
pm2 startup
pm2 save
```

3. Common PM2 commands:

```bash
# Check application status
pm2 status

# Restart application
pm2 restart webCpp

# View logs
pm2 logs webCpp

# Stop application
pm2 stop webCpp

# Delete application from PM2
pm2 delete webCpp
```

### Using Nginx as a Reverse Proxy(Recommended)

1. Install Nginx:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nginx
```

2. Create an Nginx configuration file:

```bash
sudo vi /etc/nginx/sites-available/webcpp
```

3. Add the following configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;  # Replace with your domain or server IP

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:9527;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
}
```

4. Enable the site and restart Nginx:

```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/webcpp /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t  # Test if the configuration is valid
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

5. Configure firewall to only allow Nginx and block direct access to port 9527:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'  # Allow HTTP and HTTPS through Nginx
sudo ufw deny 9527           # Block direct access to the application port
```

6. Optional: Configure the application to only listen on localhost (127.0.0.1)

For added security, you can modify the server.js file to only listen on localhost instead of all interfaces:

```javascript
// Find the server.listen line in backend/server.js
// Change from:
// server.listen(9527, () => { ... });
// To:
server.listen(9527, "127.0.0.1", () => {
  console.log("Server listening on http://localhost:9527");
});
```

This ensures application is only accessible through Nginx and not directly via port 9527 from the internet, adding an extra layer of security to deployment.
